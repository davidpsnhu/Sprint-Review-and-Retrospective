How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

System analysis may be used to interpret user demands. It may be done by soliciting input from existing users and documenting the code changes. It is necessary to identify the system's precise inputs and outputs.A user narrative is an excellent approach to communicate user requirements. It's a tool that's mostly utilized in Agile development. It might assist in comprehending the end-viewpoint. user's It also aids in determining what the user desires and writing a clear requirement description for it.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Various project management methods may be used to approach developing programs. One such technique is waterfall methodology. It aids in the projection of requirements and the implementation of certain initiatives. Iterative, prototype, agile, and incremental are some of the other techniques. Crystal, Scrum, and Extreme Programming are some of the most frequent and popular agile methods that should be covered. These methods and procedures provide distinct approaches to testing, planning, and integration.
